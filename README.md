# logitech-keyboard-weather-backlight

This is a small pet project enabling a Logitech RGB keyboard to display current outside temperature with its per-key lighting. 

Here is an example of the proposed feature:

The keyboard displays number 23 in a warm color, which means that the outside temperature is +23Â°C. 

The color of the number is changed depending on the value: the colder it is outside the cooler the color. 
Yellow-red hues signify the positive temperature, and the negative temperature is represented by blue hues.
